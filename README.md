# 👋 Hey, I’m Georgi!

🎓 Soon-to-be PhD student in Bioinformatics  
🧠 Forever curious | 🧬 DNA dreamer | 🧪 Pharmacist turned explorer of the microscopic & digital worlds

### 🌟 What Drives Me
I’m fascinated by how life works at the tiniest scale — and how we can *understand* and *influence* it using clever tools, creativity, and science.  
I don’t just want to analyze data. I want to **build ideas into reality** — from protein-DNA interactions to smart little machines that can think biologically.

Right now I’m diving deep into:
- 🧬 Molecular docking & dynamics (hello, DNase1!)
- 🤖 Language models that *speak biology*
- 🎒 Building pocket-sized science tools
- 🌍 Reproducible & open science

### 🔬 Projects I’m Dreaming Into Life

| 🌱 Idea | ✨ What It’s About |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Pocket BioCoder** | A mini science lab in your palm: insert a DNA sequence, get a ready-to-run analysis back. Built with ESP32 + Raspberry Pi + curiosity. |
| **DNA DockBot** | A research buddy that turns natural language into docking experiments. For when inspiration strikes but pipettes are out of reach. |
| **Bioinfo Snippets** | My stash of useful tools and mini-scripts for bioinformatics. Because the right tool at the right moment can spark magic. |
| **PhD Logbook** | An open journal of my PhD journey — from literature to pipelines. A transparent window into learning, failing, improving. |

### 🧠 Tools I Like Playing With
- 🐍 Python (especially with a sprinkle of Biopython)
- 🧪 Jupyter Notebooks for storytelling with data
- 🌿 R for all things stats
- 🧰 Git, Bash, and a pinch of DIY electronics

### 💡 Random Things About Me
- I love connecting ideas from **science, nature, and art**
- I believe curiosity is a superpower
- I’m obsessed with the question: *“What else could we try?”*
- I want to make science feel **fun**, **alive**, and **human**
